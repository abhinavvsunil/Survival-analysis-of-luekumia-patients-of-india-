# Survival-analysis-of-luekumia-patients-of-india-
Performed end-to-end survival analysis on Indian leukemia patient data using Kaplan–Meier curves, Log-Rank tests, ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis, and multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards models to identify key mortality risk factors.
Built predictive machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify survival outcomes, achieving ROC–AUC ≈ 0.80, outperforming traditional statistical approaches.
Developed a deep learning neural network (TensorFlow/Keras) to capture nonlinear interactions among clinical, demographic, and genetic variables.
Integrated model explainability using SHAP, aligning ML feature importance with Cox hazard ratios to ensure interpretable and clinically meaningful predictions.
Identified critical predictors including disease stage, tumor size, age, BMI, treatment type, EGFR, and KRAS mutations, supporting risk stratification and personalized treatment insights.
